# brainchip-yolov2
Brainchip's yolov2 integration into the Edge Impulse studio.

Clone repository and build container locally. The initial script in the Dockerfile should run all the way to the end displaying results of a single training run.

Futher steps to be done:

1. Add script to convert .npy files from studio to matching data for Brainchip script including bounding boxes and labels.
2. Add block to studio with test images.
3. Test execution of YOLOv2 in studio.
